summary:  InfluxDB is a time series database designed for great performance.
description: |
  InfluxDB is a time series database built from the ground up to handle high 
  write and query loads. InfluxDB is a custom high performance datastore written 
  specifically for time series data. InfluxDB is used as a backing store for any 
  timestamped data, including DevOps monitoring, application metrics, IoT sensor 
  data, and real-time analytics.

  Features
  Built-in HTTP API so you don't have to write any server side code to get up 
  and running.
  Data can be tagged, allowing very flexible querying.
  SQL-like query language.
  Simple to install and manage, and fast to get data in and out.
  It aims to answer queries in real-time. That means every data point is indexed 
  as it comes in and is immediately available in queries that should return in 
  < 100ms.
