## Overview

[InfluxDB](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb) is a 
[time series database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database) 
built from the ground up to handle high write and query loads. It is the 
second piece of the [TICK](https://influxdata.com/time-series-platform) 
stack. InfluxDB is meant to be used as a backing store for any use case 
involving large amounts of timestamped data, including DevOps monitoring, 
application metrics, IoT sensor data, and real-time analytics.
